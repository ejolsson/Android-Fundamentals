Bootcamp project involving MVVM architecture, AP connections, user login, and character scoring logic.

The application presents a Dragon Ballz battle simulator using API data and login credentials. 
* The first window presents a user login with passord. 
* The main screen presents a list of heros for the user to choose from. 
* Once the user selects a hero character, a battle simulation will be presented.
* The simulation page will present a hero life bar and three buttons: fight, take damage, and heal.
* The characters life will vary as the user selects battle events using the buttons.
